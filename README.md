Eventador
================================

A simple library (that uses a bunch of other people's libraries) for doing event routing and provides a simple event sourcing logging system
for serializing events out to an external source.

It is meant to provide an implementation of an Event Bus pattern with Event Sourcing tied in making it easier to tie together multiple
related and unrelated subscribers within a single process
